## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### Core Features
- **Chart of Accounts Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for accounts.
- **Hierarchical Tree View:** Accounts are displayed in a professional, easy-to-read parent-child tree structure.
- **Dynamic Voucher Entry:** A multi-line form with real-time total calculation for entering Journal, Payment, and Receipt vouchers. The form enforces the rule that total debits must equal total credits.
- **User & Role Management:** An admin-only section to view all registered users and assign them roles (`Admin`, `Accountant`, `Viewer`).
- **Role-Based Authorization:** A robust security system that controls access to pages and UI elements (menus, buttons) based on the logged-in user's role.

### üèÜ Bonus Feature
- **Excel Export:** The Chart of Accounts report can be downloaded as a formatted `.xlsx` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture

This project was built following the specific technical guidelines provided in the task.

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 8 with Razor Pages
- **Database:** MS SQL Server
- **Data Access:** **Stored Procedures Only**. No LINQ or standard Entity Framework queries were used for data manipulation, strictly adhering to the task requirements.
- **ORM:** Dapper (for calling stored procedures) and Entity Framework Core (for Identity management only).
- **Authentication & Authorization:** ASP.NET Core Identity with custom role-based policies.
- **UI:** Bootstrap 5, HTML5, and vanilla JavaScript (for dynamic voucher form).
- **Excel Export:** ClosedXML library.

The project follows a clean architecture with a dedicated **Data Access Layer (Repositories)** to separate database logic from the UI logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * .NET 8 SDK
    * Visual Studio 2022
    * MS SQL Server (or SQL Server Express)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-GitHub-Repository-URL]
    ```

3.  **Database Setup:**
    * Open the project in Visual Studio.
    * Open the `appsettings.json` file.
    * Modify the `DefaultConnection` string to point to your local SQL Server instance.
    * Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), create a new empty database with the name you specified in the connection string (e.g., `QtecAccountsDB`).
    * The application will automatically create all the necessary tables (for Identity and the custom tables) the first time it runs.

4.  **Create the First Admin User:**
    * Open the `Program.cs` file.
    * Find the line `var adminEmail = "your-admin-email@example.com";`
    * Change the email address to an email you will use for registration.
    * Run the application (F5).
    * Register a new user with that same email address. The application will automatically assign the "Admin" role to this user upon the next startup.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    * Log in with your new Admin user account. You will now have access to all features.
